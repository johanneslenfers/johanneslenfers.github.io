I am a first-year PhD student at the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany, where I am part of the [Parallel and Distributed Systems](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PVS/) group supervised by Professor Sergei Gorlatch. 
During my master thesis I started working on automated optimisation approaches for parallel programs in context of the [LIFT](https://www.lift-project.org) project. 
Since my PhD studies I am actively contributing to the projects [RISE](https://rise-lang.org) and [ELEVATE](https://elevate-lang.org) in close cooperation with the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The projects are supervised by [Dr. Michel Steuwer](https://michel.steuwer.info/).


I am generally interested in compilers for parallel systems with focus on automated program optimization using heuristic search strategies or machine learning.
